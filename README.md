- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Graham Kimbell.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using programming to help understand the physics of materials.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a postdoc at the University of Geneva. I use Python for data collection and analysis in my experiments on quantum materials, and am writing a numerical model for tunnelling in superconductor/ferromagnet junctions in MatLab.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @g-kimbell
- 👀 I’m interested in data anaylsis and scientific computing.
- 🌱 I’m currently writing my PhD in superconducting spintronics. I use Python for data anylsis, and am writing a numerical model for tunnelling in superconductor/ferromagnet junctions in MatLab.
- 🎓 I'm also taking courses on 'Applied Data Science with Python' and an introduction to machine learning with Tensorflow.

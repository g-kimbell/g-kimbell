- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Graham Kimbell.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in using programming to help understand the physics and chemistry of materials.
- ðŸŒ± I am a postdoc at Empa - the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology.
- ðŸ’» Currently I am working on advancing the Aurora robotic platform for coin cell assembly and testing. I also use Python for data collection and analysis in my experiments on quantum materials, and have written a numerical model for tunnelling in superconductor/ferromagnet junctions in MatLab.
